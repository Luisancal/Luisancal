# Hi there, I am Luis SÃ¡nchez
I am a **Data Sciencist** from Spain. I have been working on this field for more than a year now and I have participated in **all the stages of a data science project**: recolection, processing, storage, analysis, visualization and knowledge extraction with machine learning techniques.

I love adquiring new skills so I am constantly learning and applying new concepts to personal projects and the proffesional environment. I recently took a **PowerBI** course and I am currently taking a **Big Data and Data Science Master's Course** at Universidad Internacional de Valencia (VIU).
